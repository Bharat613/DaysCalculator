# DaysCalculator
The Days Calculator is a Java Swing application that calculates the difference between the current date and the user's selected date of birth (DOB) in terms of years, months, and days. It features a user-friendly interface with a gradient background and utilizes JDateChooser for a date picker input instead of manually typing the date.
